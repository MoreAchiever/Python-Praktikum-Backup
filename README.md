# Python Course Backup

Welcome to the Python Praktikum Backup repository! This repository contains the practical part of the module Informatik I. The course spans over two weeks, comprising 8 exercises.

## Overview

### First Week (Exercise 1-4):
The initial week served as a warm-up, focusing on fundamental concepts of Python, including Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and featuring mildly challenging exercises.

### Second Week (Exercise 5-8):
The second week delved deeper, covering topics such as HTTP requests, databases, Numpy, and Matplotlib. This week presented more challenging tasks and was slightly more time-intensive compared to the first week.

### Exercise 8:
The final part of the course culminated in Exercise 8, where participants incrementally implemented an AI capable of solving Sudoku puzzles.

## Reflection

Overall, the course provided a fulfilling learning experience. While the second week posed greater challenges, it also offered opportunities for growth and deeper exploration of Python's capabilities. Personally, I found Exercise 8 particularly enjoyable; the challenge of solving Sudoku puzzles programmatically was both stimulating and rewarding. Witnessing the AI successfully solve puzzles brought a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction.

I hope you enjoy exploring the content of this repository and find it informative and useful!
